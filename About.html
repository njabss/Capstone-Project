                        <p>Burkina Faso is a landlocked country located in West Africa. It is bordered by Mali to the northwest, Niger to the northeast, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, and Côte d'Ivoire to the southwest.</p>
                        <p>The largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso is the Mossi people, who settled the area in the 11th and 13th centuries.
